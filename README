Nyancat for your your first few harddisk sectors

Yesterday, I saw the nyancat for the master boot record on twitter: https://minemu.org/nyanmbr/
I always wanted to do something like that, but with sound, becase the nyancat is only
a nyancat with this "awesome" music in the background.

I just could not resist and hacked a SB16 driver for playing some nyan tunes this night.
The downside of this awesomeness is, that it doesn't fit in the 512 Byte boot sector anymore :(

Also the code is not very clean.
I cutted the nyancat music at 3*64K of size, because it makes copying the data into the DMA region easier.
The audio sample wastes about 250KBytes of RAM. Remember that you only have 1MB in real mode. Waste ALL the memory!

Usage:
    qemu -soundhw sb16 -hda sb16.img

I did not yet try this on real hardware, but it works in qemu.

Credits for the graphics part goes to the original creator. I just did the sound part.


Another thing:
I suspect that qemu has a bug in the SB16 interrupt handling:
I configured the DSP to issue IRQ 10 which qemu happily confirms in its debugging output.
Then, if the interrupt occurs, it issues IRQ 5 instead of my interrupt 10. Took me 2 hours to figure that out.
Would be nice if someone can confirm this.
I could have made an error, too. I didn't do anything with the SB16 until this night.
